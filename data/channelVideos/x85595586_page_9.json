It is very clean, easy to use, and very fast and wastes no time at all. Investing in OptiGrill would definitely save you a lot of money because it is so fast and easy, and you don't have to buy expensive food. It makes anything taste really good. The OptiGrill gives you exactly restaurant quality or even sometimes even better. Most restaurants I go to the OptiGrill is better. I really like it for grilled cheese. It's probably the best grilled cheese I've ever had. As a college student, I really enjoy the OptiGrill.",
