    "description": "The Fontina by Picnic Time is an original design you won't find elsewhere. It's an oval serving tray made of eco-friendly rubberwood, a hardwood known for its rich grain and durability that has two opposing carved-out sections for food. A removable cutting board made of bamboo sits in a recessed channel to stabilize the board while you're cutting. The Fontina comes with 1 stainless steel forked-tipped cheese knife with holes on its face to prevent cheese from sticking. The Fontina is the perfect hostess tray for those who like to entertain in style.\n\nComponents:\n1 removable cutting board made of bamboo\n1 stainless steel forked-tipped cheese knife with holes on its face to prevent cheese from sticking",
