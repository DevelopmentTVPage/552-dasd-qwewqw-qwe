    "description": "The Vinturi Red Wine Aerator allows red wine to breathe instantly, releasing its intended flavors and aromas.  When wine is poured through the Vinturi Red Wine Aerator, its patented design creates an increase in the wine's velocity and a decrease in its pressure, which draws in air that mixes with wine for perfect aeration.",
